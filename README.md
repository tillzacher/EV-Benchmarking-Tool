# Real-Driving-Data-driven-Vehicle-Dynamics-and-Powertrain-Analysis-based-on-Automated-ECU-Decoding

## Overview
This presents an automated data analysis tool for the analysis of vehicle dynamics and electric powertrain efficiency. The data is provided by the ECUs and is dervied from real-driving scenarios on open road tests.

The tool incorporates three main modules in a modular KDD software achrichtecture environment with Driving Resistance Identification, including various vehicle states, Power unit efficiency Analysis, inclduing efficiency maps for multiple gears, and Gear Shift Strategy, inclduing several driving modes.
The design parameters were identified in a Global Sensitivity Analysis for Robustness and Generalizability.

## Key Features
* Modular KDD software framework
* Modular and independent design parameter variation
* Vehicle Dynamics and Electric Powertrain Analysis
* Vehicle Parameter Identification for Simulation Modelling
